# Navi WordPress theme

This is a minimalist and work-in-progress WordPress. It is very much a work in progress, unrefined, and would not be ready for a theme submission, it's simply something largely put together in a weekend. It supports wide images in the new WordPress "Gutenberg" editor.

Navi means "ships" in Corsican.

Theme is GPLV2.
