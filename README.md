# Navi WordPress theme

This is a minimalist and work-in-progress WordPress theme.

It is very much a work in progress, unrefined, and would not be ready for a proper theme review, it's simply something largely put together in a weekend. It supports wide images in the new WordPress "Gutenberg" editor. The goal is to make a theme that supports wide images in as easy and clean and understandable a way as possible.

Navi means "ship" in Corsican.

## Modifying

Navi is written in SCSS, so don't edit the CSS file directly. On the Mac, you can use something like <a href="http://koala-app.com/">Koala</a> to compile from SCSS to CSS for you.

## License

Theme is GPLV2.
