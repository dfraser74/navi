# Navi WordPress theme

This is a minimalist and work-in-progress WordPress.

It is very much a work in progress, unrefined, and would not be ready for a theme submission, it's simply something largely put together in a weekend. It supports wide images in the new WordPress "Gutenberg" editor. The goal, however, is to make a theme that supports wide images in as easy and clean and understandable way as possible.

Navi means "ships" in Corsican.

Theme is GPLV2.
